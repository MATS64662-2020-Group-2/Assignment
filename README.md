# Research Software Engineering Practice 2019-2020

This is the repository for the Research Software Engineering Practice module of the AMS CDT. 

## Aim of the unit and of the assignment

The aim of the this course is to learn about modern software engineering practice, particularly to learn about python, version control and colaborating on code development using the GitHub workflow.

As a group, you should develop a program to perform image-based physics (diffusion, thermal conduction, solid mechanics etc.) simulations using:

- available open-source FE and image-analysis packages
- microstructure images from your research work, scientific literature and/or the provided image database

this is an application of what you have already covered in your python and git tutorials. Your work should include:

- documentation
- examples
- test cases

Add any further functionality as you wish.

Marks will be allocated based on the number and quality of your contributions as tracked by github [Pull Requests](https://github.com/MATS64662-2020-Group-2/xxxx/pulls) and by your participation in discussions, as recorded in [Issues](https://github.com/MATS64662-2020-Group-2/xxxx/issues).
